## 🚀 Quick Start

### Setup (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
composer install

# 2. Setup environment
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Generate keys
php artisan key:generate
php artisan jwt:secret

# 4. Configure database in .env
DB_DATABASE=order_payment_db
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

# 5. Run migrations
php artisan migrate

# 6. Start server
php artisan serve
```

### Test API (Postman)

1. Import `Order_Payment_API.postman_collection.json` into Postman
2. Register a user → Token saved automatically
3. Create an order
4. Update order status to "confirmed"
5. Process a payment

---

## 🎯 Key Implementation Highlights

### 1. Strategy Pattern Implementation

**Interface:**
```php
interface PaymentGatewayInterface
{
    public function processPayment(Order $order, array $paymentData): array;
    public function getName(): string;
    public function isConfigured(): bool;
}
```

**Context (PaymentService):**
```php
public function __construct()
{
    $this->registerGateway(new CreditCardGateway);
    $this->registerGateway(new PayPalGateway);
    $this->registerGateway(new StripeGateway);
}
```

**Adding New Gateway = 5 Steps:**
1. Create class implementing interface
2. Register in PaymentService
3. Add config to `config/payment.php`
4. Add environment variables
5. Update validation rules

### 2. Business Rule Enforcement

**Payment Confirmation Required:**
```php
if ($order->status !== 'confirmed') {
    throw new Exception('Payments can only be processed for orders with confirmed status');
}
```

**Order Deletion Protection:**
```php
if ($order->payments()->exists()) {
    return response()->json([
        'success' => false,
        'message' => 'Cannot delete order with payments'
    ], 400);
}
```

### 3. Authorization Policies

```php
class OrderPolicy
{
    public function view(User $user, Order $order): bool
    {
        return $user->id === $order->user_id;
    }

    public function update(User $user, Order $order): bool
    {
        return $user->id === $order->user_id;
    }

    public function delete(User $user, Order $order): bool
    {
        return $user->id === $order->user_id;
    }
}
```

## 💡 Assumptions & Notes

### Assumptions Made:
1. **Payment Simulation** - Payments are simulated with random success/failure rates for demonstration. In production, these would call actual gateway APIs.

2. **Order Confirmation** - Orders must be manually updated to "confirmed" status before payments can be processed. This could be automated based on business workflows.

3. **Single Currency** - All amounts are assumed to be in a single currency (e.g., USD).

4. **Payment Idempotency** - Current implementation doesn't prevent duplicate payments for the same order. In production, implement idempotency keys.

### Security Considerations:
- All API credentials stored in `.env` (never in code)
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- Authorization policies prevent unauthorized access
- Input validation on all endpoints

### Future Enhancements:
- Webhook handlers for async payment confirmations
- Payment refund functionality
- Order status transition workflow
- Rate limiting
- Database seeders for demo data
- Soft deletes
- Email notifications
- API versioning
